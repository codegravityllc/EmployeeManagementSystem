# Getting Started with Docker on Windows

This guide will help you install Docker Desktop on your Windows machine and run your application using Docker containers.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that lets you package applications and their dependencies into containers. This ensures your app runs the same everywhere â€” no more "it works on my machine" issues!

- **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) recommended

> If you're on Windows Home, you can still use Docker with WSL2.
